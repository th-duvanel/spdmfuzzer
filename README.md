# spdmfuzzer: a grammar-based fuzzer for SPDM

The `spdmfuzzer` is an object-oriented grammar-based fuzzer that takes on the role of a `Responder` in SPDM protocol communications. Its objective is to send semi-random messages to the `Requester` in order to explore unexpected responses for analysis.

The binary automatically starts the `Requester` as communication may terminate if the `Requester` does not find the received message favorable to continue the exchange. To ensure functionality, all folders and files must be maintained as organized within the repository.

If the fuzzer receives an unexpected response, it saves the message used and continues using it until a successful connection is established.

You can check a version of this document in Portuguese-Brazilian. It's available in the ``doc`` folder.

## Compilation and Execution

**Assuming you have an up-to-date Linux system. Preferably, a distribution with apt package manager.**

We strongly recommend using `spdm-wid` listed in the Related Projects section below, which is a dissector for understanding packets in tcpdump or Wireshark.

It's worth noting that the fuzzer sends messages individually (header, command, buffer, size), so there might be differences in transmission depending on how the TCP protocol aggregates sent packets into one, making it difficult for `spdm-wid` to parse as bytes may not be formatted exactly as in real communication due to emulation errors such as missing size, etc. If this occurs, simply rerun it or wait for another well-formed packet to appear.

Set the packet filter as follows:
```
tcp.port == 2323 && tcp.flags.push == 1
```

Here, you can follow two paths:
1. Compile on your own machine
2. Automatically compile in a Docker container

Regardless of the process, you need to clone the repository:
```console
foo@current-folder:~$ git clone https://github.com/th-duvanel/spdmfuzzer.git
foo@current-folder:~$ cd spdmfuzzer
```

Now you can choose one of the paths described above.

### Compile on your own machine

If installing libraries and dependencies is not an issue for you, feel free to install locally on your machine. There is no need to execute anything with elevated privileges; simply grant execution permission to the bash script.

It will run and check some dependencies on your system (not many), list them, and prompt for installation. To avoid the need to run sudo with a script, it does not install automatically. If you prefer not to run the script, below are the necessary dependencies and their versions.

You do not need to follow the specific version used. Preferably, use the latest version available in your system's package manager or use the automated tutorial in a container.

```
g++ 11.4.0
gawk 5.1.0
tar 1.34
gcc 11.4.0
git 2.34.1
wget 1.21.2
make 4.3
cmake 3.22.1
moreutils 0.66-1 # sponge
xz-utils 5.2.5
```

To do this, simply execute in the current folder:
```console
foo@spdmfuzzer:~$ sudo +x compile.sh

foo@spdmfuzzer:~$ ./compile.sh
```

If you want to monitor message exchange, start your preferred sniffer now (preferably with spdm-wid).

To execute, simply:
```console
foo@spdmfuzzer:~$ ./spdmfuzzer
```

All necessary information for understanding will be displayed in your terminal.

### Automatically compile in Docker container

The most important dependency in this case is having docker installed on your system.

This method is more automated, with fewer steps and more visual feedback. In addition to being installed and executed in a virtual environment, it will generate a .pcapng for automatic packet study exchange, unlike the previous step, which requires manually running the sniffer.

```console
foo@spdmfuzzer:~$ docker build -t spdmfuzzer .      # build

foo@spdmfuzzer:~$ docker run -ti spdmfuzzer         # execution
```

The fuzzer will run automatically and will not stop until you press ctrl + c. After pressing both keys, the container will close. In the container files, there will be a .pcapng collected with all the exchanged packets. To retrieve it, simply:

```console
foo@spdmfuzzer:~$ docker ps -a   # para capturar o id do contÃªiner
container ID        IMAGE        NAMES      ...
<container-id>      spdmfuzzer   <name>     ...

foo@spdmfuzzer:~$ docker cp <container-id>:/home/spdmfuzzer/spdmfuzzer.pcapng .     # copiar o .pcapng na pasta atual
```

By applying this .pcapng in Wireshark, you will have a complete view of the packet exchange. It is recommended again to use spdm-wid and the packet filter listed above for better visualization.

## Execution (help)

spdmfuzzer has some command-line arguments. One of them is when you encounter an unexpected response, it can wait a few seconds for the user to observe what happened. By default, it uses 3 seconds. To set the flag, simply:

```console
foo@spdmfuzzer:~$ ./spdmfuzzer -t <time(s)>
```

### Example

```console
foo@spdmfuzzer:~$ ./spdmfuzzer
# [+] => Responder (server) listening on port 2323
# [+] => Requester (client) started in the background
# [+] => Requester (client) connected

# [+] => Received command: 00 00 00 01
# [+] => Received transport type: 00 00 00 01
# [+] => Received buffer size: 00 00 00 05
# [+] => Received buffer: 05 10 84 00 00

# [+] => Sent command: 00 00 00 01
# [+] => Sent transport type: 00 00 00 01
# [+] => Sent buffer size: 00 00 00 0b
# [+] => Sent buffer: 05 50 04 00 05 00 02 07 b7 0c 65

# [+] => Received command: 00 00 00 01
# [+] => Received transport type: 00 00 00 01
# [+] => Received buffer size: 00 00 00 05
# [+] => Received buffer: 05 10 e1 00 00
# [+] => wow! this is not expected.
```

In this execution, you can see that the fuzzer received an unexpected response. Since no time flag was set, 3 seconds are given for the user to observe the unexpected response.

## Documentation Generation

Two dependencies are required for full visualization:
```console
doxygen
graphviz
```

This repository supports documentation via doxygen. If desired, simply execute:

```console
foo@spdmfuzzer:~$ make doxygen
```

Access the index.html in your browser inside the doxygen folder for the complete documentation. Alternatively, you can access it in LaTeX format as well. Note that the documentation is in English.
